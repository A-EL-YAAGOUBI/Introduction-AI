# Day 3: Introduction to Clustering: k-means and hierarchical clustering (HCA)

Welcome to Day 3 of Week 3! In this session, we will introduce you to the exciting world of clustering analysis, a popular technique in unsupervised learning. Clustering allows us to group similar data points together based on their similarities, helping us gain valuable insights into the underlying patterns and structures within the data.

## Schedule

### Part 1: Example of Unsupervised Learning: Clustering
- Understand the fundamental concepts of unsupervised learning and its applications.
- Explore the concept of clustering and its significance in various fields.
- Discover real-world examples of clustering applications and use cases.

### Part 2: Introduction to k-means Clustering
- Dive into the k-means clustering algorithm, one of the most widely used clustering techniques.
- Learn how k-means works and its iterative process of forming clusters.
- Understand the concept of centroids and the steps to find optimal cluster centers.

### Part 3: Introduction to Hierarchical Clustering (HCA)
- Explore hierarchical clustering, another powerful method for clustering analysis.
- Understand the concept of linkage criteria and how it affects the formation of clusters.
- Compare the agglomerative and divisive approaches in hierarchical clustering.

### Part 4: Hands-on Session: Implementing k-means and Hierarchical Clustering in Python
- Get hands-on experience in implementing the k-means clustering algorithm in Python.
- Learn how to find the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method.
- Dive into hierarchical clustering and visualize dendrograms to interpret the results.
