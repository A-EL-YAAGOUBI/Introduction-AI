# Day 5: Advanced Classification Algorithms

Welcome to Day 5 of Week 3! Today, we will delve into advanced classification algorithms, including Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forests. These powerful algorithms can handle complex classification tasks and are widely used in various domains.

## Schedule

### Part 1: Introduction to Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Understanding the principles and concepts behind SVM
- Exploring the use of different kernels for SVM
- Learning how SVM finds the best decision boundary

### Part 2: Introduction to Random Forests (RF)
- Understanding the fundamentals of Random Forests
- Exploring the concept of ensemble learning
- Learning how RF combines multiple decision trees for better performance

### Part 3: Hands-on session
- Implementing SVM and RF algorithms in Python
- Evaluating the performance of SVM and RF models
- Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm
