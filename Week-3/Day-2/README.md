# Day 2: Logistic Regression and Binary Classification

In this session, we will delve into logistic regression, a popular algorithm for binary classification problems. We will explore the underlying concepts of logistic regression, including the logistic function and probability estimation. By implementing logistic regression in Python, you will gain hands-on experience in building and evaluating practical Mahcine Learning models.
