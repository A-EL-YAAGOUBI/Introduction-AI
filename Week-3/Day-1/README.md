# Day 1: Introduction to Regression

Welcome to Day 1 of Week 3! In this session, we will introduce you to the world of regression analysis, a fundamental technique in machine learning and data science. We will explore the concepts of supervised and unsupervised learning, as well as regression and classification. Today, our focus will be on regression analysis.

## Schedule

### Part 1: Supervised vs Unsupervised learning and Regression vs Classification
- Understand the key differences between supervised and unsupervised learning approaches.
- Understand the key differences regression and classification.
- Learn about regression analysis and its importance in predictive modeling.
- Explore the concept of classification and its applications in machine learning.

### Part 2: Introduction to Linear Regression
- Dive into the basics of linear regression, one of the simplest and most widely used regression techniques.
- Understand the assumptions of linear regression and their implications.
- Discover the various applications of linear regression in real-world scenarios.

### Part 3: Hands-on Session: Implementing Simple Linear Regression in Python
- Get hands-on experience in implementing a simple linear regression model in Python.
- Learn how to train the model, make predictions, and evaluate its performance.
- Gain insights into interpreting the results and understanding the model's predictive capabilities.
