# Day 1: Introduction to Regression

Welcome to Day 1 of Week 3! Today, we will dive into the world of regression analysis and explore its applications in machine learning. In this session, we will differentiate between supervised and unsupervised learning and understand the distinction between regression and classification tasks. We will then delve into the fundamentals of regression analysis, including the key concepts and assumptions. 

## Schedule

### Part 1: Supervised vs Unsupervised. The example of linear regression
- Supervised vs Unsupervised learning and Regression vs Classification.
- Understanding the basics of regression analysis and its applications.
- Exploring linear regression and its assumptions.
### Part 2: Hands-on session
- Implementing linear regression.
- Evaluating linear regression.

## Additional Resources
- [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://hastie.su.domains/ISLR2/ISLRv2_website.pdf): This book provides a comprehensive introduction to statistical learning methods with a focus on practical. The Python version of the book will be available soon during the coming weeks.
- [The Elements of Statistical Learning](https://hastie.su.domains/Papers/ESLII.pdf): This book covers advanced topics in statistical learning and provides a deeper understanding of regression and other machine learning techniques.
