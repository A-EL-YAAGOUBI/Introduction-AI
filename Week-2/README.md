# Week 2: Data Manipulation and Visualization

Welcome to Week 2 of the course! In this week, we will focus on data manipulation and visualization using Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. These skills are essential for working with data in artificial intelligence tasks and machine learning. Get ready to dive into the exciting world of data wrangling and visualization!

## Course Overview
In this week, you will:
- Learn the fundamentals of NumPy for efficient array manipulation and numerical computations.
- Discover the power of Pandas for data manipulation and analysis, including working with DataFrames and performing data filtering, sorting, and grouping operations.
- Master the art of data wrangling with Pandas, including handling missing data, merging and joining DataFrames, and reshaping data.
- Explore the world of data visualization with Matplotlib, where you will create insightful and visually appealing plots to gain insights from your data.
- Level up your data visualization skills by diving into advanced techniques using Matplotlib, including subplots, multiple axes, and visualizing data distributions and relationships.
