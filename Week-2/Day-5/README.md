# Day 5: Advanced Data Visualization with Matplotlib

Welcome to Day 5 of Week 2! Today, we will dive into advanced data visualization techniques using the powerful library, Matplotlib. In this session, we will explore various topics enabling us to create compelling visualizations for our data.

## Schedule

### Part 1: More Advanced Visualization Techniques
- Subplots: Create and customize subplots to display multiple plots in a single figure.
- Heatmaps: Visualize data using color gradients to highlight patterns and relationships.
- 3D Scatter Plots: Represent data in a three-dimensional space for enhanced understanding.

These techniques are widely used in the field of artificial intelligence to visualize complex data and gain deeper insights. By the end of this part, you will have gained valuable skills in creating subplots, generating heatmaps, and visualizing data in 3D scatter plots using Matplotlib. Get ready to take your data visualization to the next level!

### Part 2: Hands-on Exercises
- Subplots: Create and customize subplots to display multiple plots in a single figure.
- Heatmaps and 2D Plotting: Generate heatmaps and explore two-dimensional data visualization techniques.
- Scatter Plots in 3D: Visualize data in a three-dimensional space using scatter plots.
