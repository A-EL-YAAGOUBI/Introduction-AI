# Day 3: Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python

Welcome to Day 3 of Week 1! Today, we will delve into the concept of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. OOP is a powerful paradigm that allows us to organize code into reusable and modular components, making it easier to manage and maintain complex projects. In this session, we will explore why OOP is essential in software development and how it can enhance our AI applications. We will also introduce key concepts such as classes, objects, and inheritance in Python.
